A modern web application for learning and practicing system design concepts. Built with the T3 Stack.

## Our Mission üåü

This project is part of a charitable initiative. All profits generated from commercial use of this software will be donated to Children of Palestine through trusted organisations.

## Features ‚ú®

- Interactive system design learning environment
- Modern tech stack with Next.js, Drizzle, and Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe API with tRPC
- Comprehensive testing setup with Vitest

## Tech Stack üíª

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) - TypeScript ORM
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) - End-to-end typesafe APIs
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) - Unit testing framework

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmadMHawwash/system-design-playground.git
cd system-design-playground
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your configuration.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Docker Development Environment

For contributors and maintainers, we've containerized the application to make setup easy without requiring API keys for third-party services.

### Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Clone and start the application**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-design-playground.git
   cd system-design-playground
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the application**: Visit http://localhost:3000

That's it! The containers will automatically:
- Set up the PostgreSQL database
- Run migrations and seed data
- Start the Next.js development server

### Development Mode Features

In development mode:
- Authentication with Clerk is mocked - you'll be logged in automatically
- A test user with 10,000 credits is created
- Rate limiting is handled in-memory instead of using Upstash
- Database persistence is maintained between restarts

The only requirement is an OpenAI API key if you want to test AI features. Set it in a `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

For more information, see [README.docker.md](./README.docker.md) and [README.database.md](./README.database.md).
