# üó∫Ô∏è 10√óarch Roadmap

> **Our Mission**: Building system design building/documenting/learning platform while supporting Children of Palestine through charitable contributions from commercial use.

## üéØ Vision Statement

To create a comprehensive, interactive, and AI-powered system design building/documenting/learning platform that helps developers at all levels master system architecture concepts through hands-on practice and intelligent feedback.
