  requirements: [
    "Users should be able to CRUD long urls and get back short urls",
    "..."
  ],
  // ... other fields
};
```

### Best Practices

1. **Requirements**
   - Be specific and measurable
   - Consider both functional and non-functional aspects (but avoid being specific with numbers. e.g., "Handle 1000rpm")
   - Ask for enhancements and improvements (e.g., "Reduce data access time to the client")

2. **Hints**
   - Provide guidance without solutions
   - Include relevant system design patterns
   - Reference real-world examples

3. **Learning Outcomes**
   - Focus on practical knowledge
   - Include industry best practices
   - Reference common pitfalls

## Instructions for Building the Challenge

### 1. Stage Progression

- **First stage**: Define the initial user need for the application.
- **Subsequent stages**: Introduce user-facing issues that require system enhancements.

### 2. Each Stage Must Include

- **Problem**: A specific issue (one or two) users face.
- **Requirements**: Product managerâ€™s instructions on features, constraints, or priorities.
- **HintsPerArea**: Provide hints in the following categories:
  - **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
  - **System API Design**
  - **Capacity Estimations** (Traffic, Storage, Memory, Bandwidth)
  - **High-Level Design**
- **Criteria**: Defines when the problem is considered solved.
  - Must be **cumulative per stage** (i.e., prior stages are required for the current stage to pass).
  - Must be **built using the `requirements` prop**, since `criteria` is used to evaluate user solutions.
- **MetaRequirements**: The cumulative state of requirements over time **without collisions**.
  - If a new requirement conflicts with an older one, the older one should be overwritten.
- **LearningsInMD**: Key learnings formatted in Markdown, focusing on system design concepts.

## Guidelines

- The challenge should be **suitable for beginners** in system design.
- Content should be **clear and concise**.
- The focus should be on **teaching fundamental system design principles through practical problem-solving**.
- The challenge should be **progressive**.
- Make sure that the requirements are actionable

---

## Implementation Notes

- Each stage should build upon previous learnings
- Include practical examples and code snippets where relevant
- Provide clear success criteria for each learning outcome
- Encourage exploration of alternative solutions
- Focus on both theoretical knowledge and practical application
- Users can only and should only do the following:
  - Drag and drop system components. System components are as the following: Client, Server, Load Balancer, Cache, CDN, Database, Message Queue, Database Cluster, Cache Cluster, Server Cluster.
  - Connect system components.
  - Describe what are these systems gonna do in high level. But they can't really implement it (for example they can't write a client side feature like clicking a button or virtualizing a list). But they can describe it.
- Describe all changes!
